This workflow can be used for identifying structurally conserved candidates from sequences of orthologous regions that can for example be obtained Multiz alignemnts. This is an extension of the Motif-Finder flavor where in the last step the clusters are filtered according to the structure conservation analysis metrics EvoFold, RNAz and R-scape. In the future release the conservation analysis feature is planned to be merged as an integrated part of the primary MotifFinder workflow.
