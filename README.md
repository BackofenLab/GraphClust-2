# Availability 
GraphClust2 is accessible on European Galaxy server at:
* [https://graphclust.usegalaxy.eu](https://graphclust.usegalaxy.eu)

It is also possible to run GraphClust2 as a stand-alone solution using a Docker container that is a pre-configured flavor of the official [Galaxy Docker image](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable).

## :whale: GraphClust2 Docker Image
=================
This Docker image is a flavor of the Galaxy Docker image customized for GraphClust2 tools, tutorial interactive tours and workflows.

### Installation and Setup:
#### Requirements:

To run GraphClust2 locally Docker client is required.
Docker supports the three major desktop operating systems  Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. Please refer to thw [Docker installation guideline](https://docs.docker.com/installation) for details.

A GUI client can also be used under Windows and Mac OS.
Please follow the graphical instructions for using Kitematic client [here](./kitematic.md).


### Running the Galaxy server
From the command line:

```bash
docker run -i -t -p 8080:80 backofenlab/docker-galaxy-graphclust
```

For details about the docker commands please check the official guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). Galaxy specific run options and configuration supports for computation grid systems are detailed in the Galaxy Docker [repository](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable).

#### Using graphic interface (Windows/MacOS):
Please check this [step-by-step guide](./kitematic/kitematic.md).

## Installation on a running Galaxy instance
GraphClust2 can be integrated into a running Galaxy server. All the GraphClust2 tools and workflows needed to run the 
    GraphClust pipeline are listed in [workflows](./workflows/) and 
    [tools-list](./assets/tools/).

#### Setup support:
In case you encountered problems please use the recommended settings, check the [FAQs](./FAQ.md) or contact us via [*Issues*](https://github.com/BackofenLab/GraphClust-2/issues) section of the repository.



#### OS supports:
GraphClust2 has been tested on these operating systems:

## Demo instance:
A running demo instance of GraphClust2 is available at http://192.52.32.222:8080/.
Please note that this instance is simply a Cloud instance of the provided Docker container, intended for rapid inspections and demonstration purposes. The computation 
capacity is limited and currently it is not planned to have a long-time availability. We recommend to follow instructions above. Please contact us if you prefer to keep this service available.

# Usage - How to run GraphClust2:

## Browser access to the server:
### Public server
Please register on our European Galaxy server [https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu) and use your authentication information to access the customized sub-domain [https://graphclust.usegalaxy.eu]. Guides and tutorial are available in the server welcome home page.

### Docker instance
After running the Galaxy docker, a web server is established under the host IP/URL and designated port (default 8080).
* Inside your browser goto IP/URL:PORT
* Following same settings as previous step
  * In the same (local) computer: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080)
  * In other systems in the network: [http://HOSTIP:8080]()

### Video tutorial
You might find this [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ6tUt_6uas) helpful to get a visually comprehensive introduction on setting-up and running GraphClust2. 


[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](./assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ6tUt_6uas)

### Interactive tours
Interactive Tours are available for Galaxy and GraphClust2. To run the tours please on top panel go to **Helpâ†’Interactive Tours** and click on one of the tours prefixed *GraphClust*. You can check the other tours for a more general introduction to the Galaxy interface.

### Import additional workflow flavors

To import or upload additional workflow flavors (e.g. from [extra-workflows directory](./workflows/extra-workflows/)), on the top panel go to *Workflow* menu. On top right side of the screen click on "Upload or import workflow" button. You can either upload workflow from your local system or by providing the URL of the workflow. Log in is necessary to access into the workflow menu. The docker galaxy instance has a pre-configured *easy!* info that can be found by following the interactive tour. You can download workflows from the following links 

#### Workflows on the running server:
Below workflows can be easily viewed and imported to the server:
  * MotifFinder: [GraphClust-MotifFinder](https://graphclust.usegalaxy.eu/u/graphclust2/w/graphclust2--motiffinder)
  * Workflow main: [GraphClust_1r](https://graphclust.usegalaxy.eu/u/graphclust2/w/graphclust2--main-1r)
  * Workflow main, preconfigured for two rounds : [GraphClust_2r](https://graphclust.usegalaxy.eu/u/graphclust2/w/graphclust2--main-2r)

Workflow overview
===============================

GraphClust pipeline for clustering RNA sequences and structured motif discovery is a multi-step pipeline. Overall it consists of three major phases: a) sequence based pre-clustering b) encoding predicted RNA structures as graph features c) iterative fast candidate clustering then refinement

|8,9| [Report results](https://graphclust.usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/rnateam/graphclust_postprocessing/glob_report/0.5) and [conservation evaluations](https://graphclust.usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/rnateam%2Fgraphclust_aggregate_alignments/graphclust_aggregate_alignments/0.1) | Collect final clusters and create example alignments of top cluster members|


### Input:
The input to the workflow is a set of putative RNA sequences in FASTA format. Inside the `data` directory you can find examples of the input format. The labeled datasets are based on Rfam annotation that are labeled with the associated RNA family.

### Configuring the workflows:
Please proceed with the interactive tour named `GraphClust workflow step by step`, available under `Help->Interactive Tours` and also check the Publications.
An easy to understand tutorial highlighting the use-case scenarios and the few parameters that can be adapted according to the scenarios will be provided soon [here](./workflows/).
Generally the pre-configured *main* workflows would perform well for clustering and partitioning a set of RNA sequences with defined boundary signals (e.g. ncRNAs or data from genomic screenings with tools such as CMfinder or RNAz).The *MotifFinder* workflow flavor is pre-configured for identifying (a few) local signal under the presence of noise and sequence context.

### Output:
The output contains the predicted clusters, where similar putative input RNA sequences form a cluster. Additionally overall status of the clusters and the matching of cluster elements is reported for each cluster.
